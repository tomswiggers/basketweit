Add a score summary to your WP Club Manager single match pages.

== Description ==

Score Summary is an extension for [WP Club Manager](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-club-manager/) which adds a summary of your matches scores at the end of each period or at half time to the single match pages.

Simply install and activate. Once active you will be able to add score summaries to your matches in the create/edit match screen.

**Requires at least WP Club Manager 1.1.7**

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WPCM Score Summary, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WP Club Manager Score Summary” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work as expected but as always, it is recommended that you backup your site just in case any problems should occur during the update process.
