== Upgrade Notice ==

1.3.0 is a major update so it is important that you make backups, test extensions and your theme prior to updating.

=Possible Upgrade Issues=

If you have setup your club without any teams you may have some problems with player stats. If this happens, don't panic. Nothing has been lost but it is now necessary to create at least one team for your club and assign matches and players to a team. This is an unavoiable side effect of the new player stats by team feature and will only need to be done once. Player stats will recover once players and matches are assigned.

There are some small changes to a number of templates so if you have a custom theme with modified WP Club Manager templates we recommend that you test your theme and make any necessary changes before updating.
