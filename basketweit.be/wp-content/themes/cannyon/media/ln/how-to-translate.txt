Firstly you'll need a tool allowing you to translate .po file into your language.

You can use Poedit app, or CodeStyling  WordPress Plugin.

After you unzip the archive cannyon.zip  you must have folder "cannyon" with theme files.

After this go to cannyon/media/languages/ here you can see file en_US.po. Now here create new file,

for example fr_FR.po and copy content from en_US.po to fr_FR.po ( to copy content use sample text editor ).

After open fr_FR.po ( using poeditor ) and start translating each word to your language.

After you finished, click button "Save Catalog", and it will create a new .mo file in the same folder.

Then you'll need to open wp-config.php file from the root folder of your WordPress install, and replace this line:

define ('WPLANG', '');

with something like:

define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');

Then make sure that .mo file from cannyon/media/ln/ folder of our theme has the same name as your language code: "fr_FR.mo"

IMPORTANT: Is need by one .po file for each language, in case you want to use plugin mqTranslate to enable more languages.
